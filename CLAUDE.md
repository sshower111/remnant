# Remnant (repo: recipe-pantry-app)

A local pipeline that ingests cooking shorts/reels, extracts text/audio ingredients locally,
normalizes them into structured JSON, stores them in SQLite, and lets the user query recipes
based on available pantry items. Everything runs locally: no cloud APIs.

The app is called **Remnant** ("cook with what's left"; renamed from Cookbook on 2026-11-05):
display name, share-sheet entry, feed title, app icon (`ios/Art/app-icon/*.svg` -> the
`AppIcon` PNGs: cream bowl with a sprig on terracotta, user's pick; dark and tinted variants;
no tossing food or cook-with-a-wok imagery in the icon, the user's rule) and
the `remnant://recipe/<id>` URL scheme. The Xcode project, targets, folders, Swift type names
and bundle ids stay `Cookbook` on purpose: a new bundle id would install a second app and lose
the phone's offline copy and settings. Built (Release) and installed on the iPhone 2026-11-05.

## Technology Stack

- **Ingestion:** yt-dlp (video metadata, captions, audio)
- **Transcription:** faster-whisper (local audio-to-text)
- **OCR (optional, `requirements-ocr.txt`):** EasyOCR on ffmpeg-sampled video frames
- **LLM parsing:** Ollama running `qwen2.5:7b` via the local API (`http://localhost:11434`)
- **Database:** SQLite (`recipes`, `ingredients`, `recipe_ingredients`, `recipe_steps`)
- **Supporting:** requests (Ollama HTTP), pydantic v2 (output validation), python-dotenv, pytest

## Phase Breakdown

1. **Scaffolding** (done): project layout, venv setup instructions (README), `requirements.txt`,
   `requirements-dev.txt`, and `config.py`.
2. **Ingestion & Extraction Pipeline (`pipeline/`)** (done):
   - `downloader.py`: download audio/captions with yt-dlp.
   - `transcriber.py`: run faster-whisper on audio files.
   - `parser.py`: build prompt payloads and call Ollama for structured JSON:
     `{"title": str, "sources": [...], "yield_label": str|null,
       "ingredients": [{"name": str, "amount": float|null, "unit": str|null}], "steps": [str]}`.
     `ParsedRecipe.output_schema()` marks every field required for Ollama even though `steps`
     defaults to `[]` in Python.
   - `ingest.py`: orchestrates URL → media → transcript → recipe → DB.
3. **Database & Query Engine (`db/`)** (done):
   - `schema.py`: SQLite schema (`recipes`, `ingredients`, `recipe_ingredients`) and `connect()`.
   - `repository.py`: insertion with normalized ingredient mapping (`save_recipe`), reads.
   - `pantry.py`: `find_recipes_by_pantry(conn, available_ingredients: list[str], ...)` returns
     recipes using at least one selected ingredient, ranked by how many selected ingredients they
     use (most first), then fewest other ingredients (user's choice: "uses any, best first"; the
     CLI's `--max-missing` was dropped, the function keeps `max_missing` as an optional filter).
4. **Native iOS app** (done on `ios-app`, all runbook build steps 1-8): SwiftUI app in `ios/`
   (iOS 17+) reading the FastAPI server over Wi-Fi: cookbook feed with ingredient search,
   cooking mode, cooking-step Live Activity, Settings, offline copy, share-sheet ingest.
   Runbook: `docs/ios/README.md`; JSON contract: `docs/ios/api.md` (regenerate its samples
   if API responses change).

```

## Design Rules & Conventions

- **Same normalization on both sides.** Recipe ingredients and pantry queries both go through
  `db/normalize.py::normalize_ingredient_name`. Matching relies on consistency, not perfect
  linguistics. Add synonyms to `ALIASES` there; add tests in `tests/test_normalize.py`; then run
  `main.py renormalize` so stored rows pick up the change. Accents on Latin letters are folded
  (`purée` -> `puree`); letters in other scripts are kept, never stripped.
- **Keep the raw text.** `recipe_ingredients.raw_name` stores the original wording; `ingredients.name`
  is the canonical shared name. The same ingredient may appear twice in one recipe.
- **Record where ingredients came from.** `recipes.ingredient_sources` lists the inputs the parser
  read them from (`description`, `speech`, `captions`, `title`, `on_screen`, `recipe_page`,
  `visual` = the vision model's reading of keyframes; `comments` is reserved). `transcript_source` only says which transcript was sent to the model.
- **English output.** The prompt requires title, yield and ingredient names in English whatever
  the video's language (verified on Spanish, Japanese and Cantonese text with qwen3.5:9b);
  the original-language text stays in `description` / `transcript`.
- **One ingredient list per recipe, with its yield.** `recipes.yield_label` records what the amounts
  make ("serves 4", "1 standard loaf pan"). When a post gives several batch sizes, the parser keeps
  only the standard/smallest home-size one, never a mix (user's choice: no multi-version storage).
- **Schema changes to existing tables** go in `_ADDED_COLUMNS` in `db/schema.py`, since
  `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` won't touch an existing database.
- **Upsert by canonical `source_url`.** `pipeline/urls.py::canonical_url` maps share-link variants
  (Instagram `/reel/` vs `/p/`, `?igsh=`, `youtu.be`, `/shorts/`) to one URL; always store and
  look up through it. Re-ingesting replaces the recipe and its ingredient lines. `batch` skips
  stored URLs before downloading unless `--refresh`; `ingest` updates unless `--skip-existing`.
- **`db/` is independent of `config.py`.** DB functions take explicit arguments (path, staples);
  the CLI/pipeline pass settings in.
- **Lazy-import faster-whisper** (inside functions) so DB-only commands and tests stay fast.
  `pipeline/__init__.py` stays empty for the same reason.
- **Ollama calls** use `/api/chat` with `format` = `ParsedRecipe.model_json_schema()`,
  `temperature: 0`, `stream: false`, and are validated with pydantic, with one retry on bad output.
- **Thinking models:** send `think: false` by default (`RECIPE_OLLAMA_THINK`). With thinking on,
  `qwen3.5:9b` timed out at 180s; with it off, a parse takes ~30-40s on this machine.
- **OCR fallback** (`RECIPE_OCR`: auto | always | off). In `auto`, OCR runs only when the first
  parse has < 3 ingredients or no amounts (`ingest.looks_incomplete`), or there is no text at all;
  the video is downloaded separately (`download_video`), frames sampled with ffmpeg `mpdecimate`,
  read with EasyOCR, lines grouped (`ocr.group_lines`) and fuzzy-deduped (`ocr.merge_frame_text`),
  then re-parsed. The retry is kept only if it has at least as many ingredients. OCR failures
  are logged and never fail an ingest. Raw text goes in `recipes.on_screen_text`. Lazy-import
  EasyOCR (inside `pipeline/ocr.py::_reader`), like faster-whisper.
- **Visual fallback for silent videos** (`RECIPE_VISUAL`: auto | off). `ingest.is_silent`:
  no real captions and Whisper heard < `RECIPE_VISUAL_MIN_WORDS` (5) words, sound tags like
  "[Music]" not counted. In `auto` it runs last (after recipe page and OCR) when the video is
  silent and the result has no steps or looks incomplete. `pipeline/frames.py` takes ffmpeg
  keyframes (every `RECIPE_VISUAL_INTERVAL` s + scene changes, `showinfo` timestamps),
  `parser.parse_visual_recipe` sends them as Ollama `images` with a frame/time list and gets
  `{"title", "steps": [{"step_number", "timestamp_start", "instruction", "ingredients_used"}]}`
  (times snapped to the frames shown). `ingest.merge_visual`: written text wins; frames only
  fill missing steps (times in `recipe_steps.start_seconds`) and, when there's no ingredient
  list, names without amounts (source label `visual`). One video download is shared with OCR
  (`ingest.VideoFile`). Failures are logged, never fail an ingest. `reparse` keeps steps that
  have start times when the new parse has none. `video-steps` applies it to stored recipes
  (`ingest.steps_from_video`: video download only, stored ingredients kept): by default every
  ready recipe with no steps whose saved transcript is silent; `--todo` adds needs_recipe
  posts (they turn ready if the frames give ingredient names); explicit ids skip the silence
  check; `--refresh` reads again the steps that have start times (never written steps).
  The model gets the stored ingredient list with amounts (`parser.ingredient_line`). Prompt
  rules from the user's review of recipe 54 (2026-11-05): no setup/handling steps (gathering,
  opening packets, serving suggestions), simple prep folded into the step that uses it
  ("Fold in the chopped dark chocolate"), amounts written when an ingredient goes in all at
  once ("Add 80 g granulated sugar"), none for an ingredient split across steps.
  Verified on the PC (2026-11-04, qwen3.5:9b reads images): 5 stored recipes, 6-20
  keyframes each, 3-14 steps. Posts with no ingredient list whose caption points elsewhere
  (`urls.points_elsewhere`: DM me, link in bio, blog) are never read from video, on ingest or
  by `video-steps` (recipe 39, a "DM for the recipe" post, got a 3-ingredient guess). Start
  times are stored (they mark steps read from video) but never shown: the user doesn't want
  timestamps, so `show` and the API leave them out.
- **Recipe pages** (`RECIPE_RECIPE_PAGES`, default on). When a parse looks incomplete and the
  caption links to a non-social page (`urls.recipe_link`), `webrecipe.fetch_recipe_page` reads its
  schema.org Recipe JSON-LD and the model re-parses with a RECIPE PAGE section. This runs before
  OCR (cheaper, exact). Failures (home-page-only link, HTTP 403 bot blocking, no recipe data) are
  logged and skipped; never try to get around a site's bot blocking. Page URL/text are stored in
  `recipe_page_url` / `recipe_page_text`. `import-page` applies it to stored recipes from their
  saved text (no re-download), or with `--url` for "link in bio" posts. For sites that block
  the app, `--file` takes a page the user saved in their browser (Ctrl+S; read the same way,
  address from its canonical link) or a .txt with the ingredient list pasted in
  (`webrecipe.read_recipe_file`). A bad local file never sets the recipe's `status_note`.
- **Instagram comments** were tested and not wired in: signed out, yt-dlp only gets ~12 of
  hundreds of comments, none by the creator on the to-do posts; signing in risks the user's
  account. The `comments` source label stays reserved.
- **Steps.** The same model call returns the method (`steps`), taken only from what the post,
  speech, on-screen text or recipe page says; recipe pages contribute `recipeInstructions`
  (strings, HowToStep, HowToSection), pasted text files a section after an "Instructions:" /
  "Method:" heading. Stored in `recipe_steps`, replaced on every save. Adding steps made a parse
  ~2 min instead of ~1. `reparse` re-runs the model on stored text (no downloads) and never
  replaces existing ingredients with an empty parse; `import-page` without `--url` re-fetches the
  page imported before (pages stored before steps existed lack instructions).
- **Short steps.** `recipe_steps.short_text` is a ~50-character version of each step for the
  iOS Dynamic Island / Lock Screen ("Mix the sauce ingredients"), from a second, small model
  call (`parser.shorten_steps`: steps + ingredient names only). Its schema has one required
  key per step (`step_1`, ...): with a plain list, qwen3.5:9b merged 10 steps into one item. Ingest and `reparse` run it after the parse; failures are logged
  and leave NULLs. `shorten-steps` fills stored recipes from their saved steps (ingredients
  untouched). A version that is empty or not shorter is stored NULL; the app then shortens `text`.
- **Transcript choice:** use platform captions if ≥ 40 chars and `RECIPE_PREFER_CAPTIONS`, else
  Whisper. The video description is always included in the prompt (reels often put the recipe there).
- **Silent reels:** Instagram serves a video-only file when a reel has no audio; faster-whisper
  crashes on it ("tuple index out of range"), so `transcriber.has_audio` is checked first and
  Whisper is skipped. EasyOCR's per-frame PyTorch CPU warnings are filtered in `ocr._quiet_torch`.
- **Posts without an ingredient list** (recipe on a blog, "link in bio", comment-a-keyword DMs,
  or not a recipe) are still saved: the row acts as a cache so `batch` skips them next time
  instead of re-downloading/OCR-ing. `recipes.status` is `ready` (has ingredients),
  `needs_recipe` (caption points elsewhere; `status_note` records failures such as a site's 403),
  or `not_recipe` (user confirmed these are non-recipe videos: food vlogs, ads, restaurant
  visits). `save_recipe` forces `ready` when there are lines and leaves NULL when not told;
  `main.open_db` backfills NULLs via `urls.classify_missing_recipe`. `list` shows only ready,
  `list --todo` the needs_recipe to-do list, `list --all` everything. Empty posts have no
  `ingredient_sources`. `list`/`show`/`ingest` label them; `pipeline/urls.py::recipe_link` and
  `points_elsewhere` find the caption's external recipe link or hint (`show` also prints
  "Full recipe:" for normal recipes). Pantry search never returns them (no ingredient rows).
  The iPhone app relabels them (`PATCH /api/recipes/{id} {"status"}`, `db.set_status`, never
  for rows with ingredients): "Save for later" = `needs_recipe` (its 🔖 list), "Remove" =
  `not_recipe`. "Check again" re-ingests with `refresh`; a `needs_recipe` post that still
  has no list stays `needs_recipe` instead of being re-classified.
- **Caption failures** (e.g. YouTube 429) trigger a retry without captions rather than failing.
- **Pantry staples** (`RECIPE_PANTRY_STAPLES`: salt, black pepper, water, oil) are excluded from
  scoring entirely, not counted as matched.
- **Thumbnails, marks, step ingredients.** Thumbnails are downloaded at ingest
  (`MediaAssets.thumbnail_url`, `pipeline/thumbnails.save_thumbnail`) because platform image
  URLs expire; only the file name is stored (`recipes.thumbnail_file`), failures are logged
  and never fail an ingest. `favorite`/`tried`/`hidden` are user marks: `save_recipe`'s upsert
  must never touch them. Per-step ingredients are matched from wording at read time
  (`db/step_ingredients.py`; uses `normalize_ingredient_name(..., aliases=False)` so "white
  sugar" isn't just "sugar"), not stored. Step timers come from the step's wording
  (`ios/Cookbook/Models/StepTimer.swift`: "28-32 minutes" -> 28 min).
- **The web app** (Next.js in `web/`) was removed on 2026-11-04 at the user's request: this is
  an iPhone app with a Python backend. It's in git history (`4937190`) if ever needed.
- **Native iOS app** (`ios/`; built and run on the iPhone, never a Simulator: see Environment;
  the one exception is the README's demo media, captured in the Simulator with the user's OK).
  - Feed: the search box is pinned to the bottom (thumb reach; user's choice 2026-11-09).
    Typing finds recipes by title or ingredient (`Models/IngredientSearch.swift`, on the
    phone's copy of every recipe: "beef" finds beef slice and ground beef; "chicken" also
    finds drumstick/wing/thigh; flavourings like chicken powder or stock still match but
    rank after the real thing). It also takes "what you have" (ingredient chips re-rank the
    feed with the same matching, on the phone; the app no longer calls `/api/pantry`; no
    separate Pantry tab, the user's choice). Filters All / ❤️ /
    👌🎉 (the API's `tried`, shown as "Cooked" everywhere) / 🔖 (`?status=todo`). Filter
    switches don't animate: animating the feed or a sliding pill stuttered on the phone.
  - Thumbnails (`Views/Thumbnail.swift`) are decoded at their drawn size off the main thread
    and cached in memory; photos come from URLCache once downloaded (offline too).
  - Offline (`Store/OfflineStore.swift`): the feed, 🔖 list and every recipe are saved as JSON
    and shown first; the PC being out of reach keeps them with an "Offline" tag. API calls
    time out after 8 s. Marks and Check again need the PC; search works offline.
  - Cooking progress (step in focus, done steps, the step timer) lives on the phone
    (`Shared/CookingProgress.swift`, UserDefaults), shared with the Live Activity.
  - Recipe screen: ▶ opens the post only in its app (`UIApplication.open` with
    `universalLinksOnly`; no app installed = an alert offering Safari), never a browser on its
    own: the browser asks people to sign in. Ingredient tiles show black-and-white icons
    (`Models/IngredientIcon.swift`, keyword rules on the canonical name, specific first):
    proteins as their animal (cow, pig, chicken, duck, fish), one mixed-vegetables icon for
    every vegetable, one fruits icon; sources/licenses in `ios/Art/icons` (Health Icons CC0,
    Tabler MIT, Lucide ISC; Tabler/Lucide strokes thinned to 1.25 to match). The tile box
    holds only the icon; the amount leads the name under it ("3 tbsp Soy sauce"). The
    "N ingredients" pill opens the whole list in a sheet (`Views/IngredientListSheet.swift`,
    tap to tick off while shopping).
  - Cooking mode: the step card (`Views/StepCard.swift`) is a paging horizontal scroll view
    (swipe between steps; a hand-made drag stuttered). No floating copy of the card while
    scrolling (removed 2026-11-09 at the user's request). The step list shows every step in
    full; the current step's whole row sits on a terracotta-tinted block.
  - Live Activity (`CookingActivity/`): follows Apple's Live Activities HIG in the app's look
    (SF Pro, cream/terracotta; Lock Screen cream or warm dark by appearance, 14 pt margins;
    the cook as logo mark; one ‹ | › control plus ✕; compact/minimal fit the 28 pt circle,
    a progress ring or the timer). The expanded island picks 3 or 2 lines with ViewThatFits:
    iOS gives it less height on a long press than when an alert opens it, and a greedy
    (`maxHeight: .infinity`) region squeezed the instruction to one line.
    It starts on ▶ (watch), or on leaving a recipe
    (`.inactive`; iOS refuses requests once in the background) if Settings' switch is on;
    ends whenever the app is active again, on the island's ✕ (`EndCookingIntent`), and when
    the app is closed in the app switcher: iOS keeps activities after their app quits and
    tells a suspended app nothing, so leaving (`.inactive`) starts a ~25 s background task
    and willTerminate ends the activities (run loop kept turning, not a blocked main thread;
    verified on the phone). Closed after that window, the ✕ is the way. iOS collapses the
    expanded island by itself, so a
    silent alert (`Resources/silence.caf`) re-opens it on start and on every ‹ › tap.
    ‹ › run `ChangeStepIntent` (a LiveActivityIntent, so in the app's process: no App Group
    needed). Keep the Lock Screen card and expanded island under ~160 pt, or iOS crops them.
    Island text prefers the server's `short_text`, else `Step.islandText`'s regex shortening.
  - The pixel chef (2026-11-05, user's frames; `ios/Shared/ChefMascot.swift`,
    `Shared/ChefMascot.xcassets` in both targets, source GIFs in `ios/Art/chef-mascot`):
    assets `chef_<state>_<n>`; every Image of it uses `.interpolation(.none)`.
    `AnimatedChefView` steps frames on a task clock (still under Reduce Motion). States: splash
    (`SplashScreenView`, 1.4 s over the feed at launch), refresh (feed pull-to-refresh, the
    system spinner tinted clear), loading (shared-post cards, recipe loading), empty (❤️),
    success (all steps done), error (failed share, recipe load). Only `chef_toss_0...8`
    (68 px, 5 fps) exist so far: any state whose `_0` frame is missing plays the toss. The
    Live Activity can't animate, so it shows stills (`ChefStill`, a pose per step): toss in
    expanded/Lock Screen, `head_compact` compact, `wok_minimal` minimal (timer wins there).
  - The old corner cook (replaced by the pixel chef; font still bundled, unused):
    `CookFlip.ttf`'s digits are 10 outline poses, one per step (`CookFrame`). A 1 frame/s flipbook through `Text(timerInterval:)` in that font was
    tried and doesn't render: iOS draws timer text itself and ignores custom fonts (verified
    in the Simulator: static text in the font shows, the timer is blank). Rebuild with
    `ios/tools/draw_cook_frames.swift` -> `ios/Art/cook-frames/*.svg` ->
    `ios/tools/make_flipbook_font.py`. The cook is an original drawing: don't copy existing
    characters (the user asked for old-school anime style, not Dragon Ball characters).
  - Share sheet (`AddToCookbook/`): posts the link to `POST /api/ingest`; the PC's queue
    (`api/jobs.py`) runs one job at a time with `ingest_url(..., skip_existing=True)`, in
    memory (a uvicorn restart drops queued jobs). The feed polls `GET /api/ingest` and shows
    "Adding..." cards. The extension can't read the app's Settings (no App Group on a free
    Apple ID), so its server address is hard-coded: keep it in sync with
    `APIClient.defaultServerURL` (`http://192.168.2.23:8000`; give the PC that address with a
    DHCP reservation so it doesn't change).
  - Free Apple ID signing: the app must be re-installed every 7 days.
- Downloaded media is deleted after ingest unless `RECIPE_KEEP_MEDIA=true`.

## Environment Notes (this machine)

Two machines on the home Wi-Fi (user's decision, 2026-11-03: the 16 GB M1 struggled running
everything):

- **Windows PC = backend.** Pipeline (yt-dlp, faster-whisper, Ollama `qwen3.5:9b`), SQLite
  (`data/recipes.db`) and `uvicorn api.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`. Ingest, `reparse`,
  `import-page` and other data commands run there; it has the authoritative database. Changes
  to `api/` or `db/` reach it via git (push here, pull there, restart uvicorn).
- **MacBook Air (Apple M1, 16 GB) = development client only.** Xcode, Claude Code, git,
  pytest. Do **not** run Ollama models, the pipeline, `uvicorn` or iOS Simulators here. Build
  the iOS app for and run it on the physical iPhone (`xcodebuild ... -configuration Release
  -destination 'id=<udid>'`, then `xcrun devicectl device install app`); Debug builds made
  SwiftUI noticeably laggy on the phone. The user checks the screen, since Claude's simulator
  tools don't reach a real device. Keep background processes to a minimum.
- Mac details: macOS 27, default shell bash, Homebrew `python@3.12` (`python3.12`), venv at
  `.venv/` (enough for pytest), Xcode 27. `node@22` is keg-only: `~/.bash_profile` adds
  `/opt/homebrew/opt/node@22/bin` to PATH. Ollama is installed but idle; its models were
  deleted 2026-11-05 when the disk filled up (the build failed with 108 MB free), along with
  Xcode DerivedData, iOS DeviceSupport and the Simulator devices. Check `df -h /` first if a
  build fails oddly. `devicectl` device names use a curly apostrophe ("Keith’s iPhone"):
  install with the UDID instead. The
  Mac's `data/` is a stale copy from the brief 2026-11-03 move; don't treat it as current.
- Timings quoted above ("~30-40s", "~2 min" per parse, OCR durations) were measured on the PC.

## Not Yet Verified / Open Items

- End-to-end `ingest` verified on a public Instagram post (Whisper path, qwen3.5:9b). Not yet run
  against a live YouTube URL or the platform-captions path.
- Private/login-gated Instagram reels may need yt-dlp cookies (`cookiefile` / `cookiesfrombrowser`),
  not wired up yet; the public post worked without them.
- `av<19` is pinned in `requirements.txt`: faster-whisper 1.2.1 passes `metadata_errors` to
  `av.open()`, which PyAV 19 rejects. Drop the pin once faster-whisper fixes this.
- OCR verified on a synthetic text-only video (all lines read, parsed correctly) and on the real
  Instagram reel (`RECIPE_OCR=always`: 60 frames, ~4.5 min total vs ~1.5 min without). Not yet
  tested on a real reel whose ingredients appear only on screen.
- Public on GitHub: https://github.com/sshower111/recipe-pantry-app (MIT).
